# Given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which begins with a slash '/', 
# transform this path into its simplified canonical path.

# In Unix-style file system context, a single period '.' signifies the current directory, 
# a double period ".." denotes moving up one directory level, and multiple slashes such as "//" are 
# interpreted as a single slash. In this problem, treat sequences of periods not covered by 
# the previous rules (like "...") as valid names for files or directories.

# The simplified canonical path should adhere to the following rules:

# It must start with a single slash '/'.
# Directories within the path should be separated by only one slash '/'.
# It should not end with a slash '/', unless it's the root directory.
# It should exclude any single or double periods used to denote current or parent directories.
# Return the new path.

# Example 1:
# Input: path = "/home/"
# Output: "/home"
# Explanation:
# The trailing slash should be removed.

# Example 2:
# Input: path = "/home//foo/"
# Output: "/home/foo"
# Explanation:
# Multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

# Example 3:
# Input: path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"
# Output: "/home/user/Pictures"
# Explanation:
# A double period ".." refers to the directory up a level.

# Example 4:
# Input: path = "/../"
# Output: "/"
# Explanation:
# Going one level up from the root directory is not possible.

# Example 5:
# Input: path = "/.../a/../b/c/../d/./"
# Output: "/.../b/d"
# Explanation:
# "..." is a valid name for a directory in this problem.
