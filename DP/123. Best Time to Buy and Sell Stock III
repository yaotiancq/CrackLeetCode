# You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
# Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.
# Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

# Example 1:
# Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
# Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

"""
Typical hard DP problem. It need 5 status to correctyly describe the whole status transfer process.
0 No operation
1 First time hold stock
2 First time don't hold stock
3 Second time hold stock
4 Second time don't hold stock

How to describe status transfer process? May be we can first establish a table and try to simulate the answer solving process. 
After all, how to deduct answer from beginning is DP.

Limit times means when to buy or sell is a dp process needed to consider, it should be represented in dp process. It means the expansion of the scale of dp table.
